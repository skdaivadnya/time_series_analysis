# time_series_analysis
this is the project about anomaly detection in a pump-sensor dataset. In this project we use heuristics based method to perform anamoly detection. 
We clean the data following the preprocessing of data.
plotting the data for better understanding.
Predict the anamolies with respect to the plotted data points.
